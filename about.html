            <p>
                My name is Elijah Medina, I am a 21 year old Computer Science major from Lansing, Michigan. I currently go to school at Michigan State University,
                and am currently in my fourth year! I've lived in Lansing for my whole life, but I have some family in Florida as well. I also love to draw! Here you can see some of my artwork!
            </p> 
            <p>I like to make drawings in Clip Studio Paint, and will either draw with my mouse, or I draw will my tablet and stylus. I also have a few interests and hobbies other than drawing, heres a few!</p>

            <p>This is a sketch I made of Choso from Jujutsu Kaisen, an anime that I like. I made this drawing after the recent episode that had him in it.</p>

            <p>
                2 years ago I made this render based off the music video "Look at the Sky" by Porter Robinson. I screenshotted a part of the music video, and traced over it 
                to break up the shading so that it was easier for me to color pick and blend the colors together. I have a speedpaint video of the process as well!

            <p>
                This is a work in progress drawing I'm making of Furina from Genshin Impact, her design is very intricate so I'm taking my time with it!
