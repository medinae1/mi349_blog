        <p>
            My name is Elijah Medina, I am a 21 year old Computer Science major from Lansing, Michigan. I currently go to school at Michigan State University,
            and am currently in my fourth year! I've lived in Lansing for my whole life, but I have some family in Florida as well. I also love to draw! Here is a recent sketch I made!
