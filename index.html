                <em>Census Designated</em> is the sophomore album by Jane Remover, an American musician from New Jersey who is well known for her debut album <em>Frailty</em> along with her old artist aliases she used on SoundCloud. I stumbled across her music when I heard her song "movies for guys", which is a song about falling in love with a crush who you know can never love you back, so you force yourself to hate them. While her debut album has more of an electronic dance sound with wildly changing genres, <em>Census Designated</em> pulls back on the harsh electronic noise that was prevalent in her previous works. This album feels more intimate than the previous album, with Remover seeming to focus more on specific events that might have happened in her life. This album also has a much stronger focus on the lyricism and every song is pretty lengthy with Jane Remover's vocals appearing in every song. However, it seems this album lets go of some of the autotune that was apparent in her previous album. A large majority of the songs have a drop where the song shifts and becomes more rock heavy that tends to mix into electronic warbling. This album's sound in general just reminds me of my own life, and feels almost nostalgic in a way. I believe that the album cover beautifully encapsulates the feeling I get while listening.
